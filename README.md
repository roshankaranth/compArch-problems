Computer Architecture Lab Problems

In case of gate level modelling :
    - all signals are wires. no regs used.
    
In case of Dataflow modelling :
    - all signals are wires. no regs used.

In case of behavioral modelling :
    - inputs, connections are wire
    - any signal assigned inside always block.

In case of Testbench:
    - inputs are reg.
    - outputs are wires.
